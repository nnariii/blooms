    <p class="title">From Theory to Practice</p>

	Being a nursing student is incredibly challenging. Almost everyone in the program would agree. There are numerous deadlines to meet, countless skills to practice, and step-by-step demonstrations with rationales that need to be memorized. And don’t even get me started on the emotional toll these tasks can take. Personally, 
    I often find myself crying over minor inconveniences on days when everything feels too overwhelming.	
    <br>
    <br>
Before I stepped into the hospital, I felt like I was ready. I believed I knew how procedures were supposed to be performed. I kept practicing drug computations, memorized the medical abbreviations I thought I needed to know, and mastered how to take vital signs. Or at least, that’s what I thought.
<br>
<br>
When I first prepared medications, I couldn’t do it properly. My clinical instructor asked me a simple question, and I couldn’t even answer it correctly. In my head, all I could think was, “Ma’am, I swear I’m not this stupid.” Then came my first time taking a patient’s vital signs—I couldn’t 
even hear the Korotkoff sounds. When we got back to the conference room? Lo and behold, the stethoscope was turned off. I blamed the innocent ceiling fan for that “lutang” moment. And the first RLE quiz at the hospital? It was about medical abbreviations, and I only recognized about six! I had
 memorized so many, but apparently, it still wasn’t enough.
 <br>
 <br>
But let’s move on from my personal mishaps and get to what really matters—my realizations. 
<br>
During my first rotation, I came to a humbling realization: just because you're good at the theoretical side of nursing doesn't mean you'll automatically excel in clinical practice. You might know how to compute the correct dosages, but still find yourself overwhelmed—unsure whether the amount you
 calculated is for the medication itself or for its diluent. You might understand that a patient’s symptoms are within normal limits, but your empathy kicks in, and suddenly you're panicking because those symptoms aren’t going away. It felt like being slapped on both cheeks by reality.
 <br>
 <br>
And yes—being an empath can sometimes feel like your worst enemy. Watching a mother panic over her child, or having an elderly woman ask for help when all you can offer is emotional support—it’s heartbreaking. You can’t even give them full reassurance, because that would mean offering false hope. 
The truth is, you’re just a student. You don’t have all the answers. You’re still learning how things are supposed to be done. And more than that, you’re still learning how to care for others while figuring out how to care for yourself.
<br>
<br>
One piece of advice a clinical instructor gave us? Cry. Not in front of the patient, of course. But cry when you can’t hold it in anymore. Cry when a relative scolds you. Cry when a patient passes away during your shift. Because in this field, you won’t make it through without shedding a few tears. 
There will be plenty of reasons to cry, and bottling it all up isn’t healthy.
Because this is the reality of our field. It is not for the weak.
<br>
<br>
But of course, it is a privilege. It is a privilege to complain about how tired I am during my clinicals. It is not only about memorizing and mastering the procedures, it is also about showing up. No matter how hard it is, or no matter how toxic the shift gets, what’s important is that I showed up. 
<br>
<br>
So no, it’s not for the weak. But I refuse to give up and I plan to build myself up to be the nurse that I want to be treating me, or my family. It is for the people who are willing to become strong.

(But also, please compensate us better TT~TT)
